🌱 Studying Applied Computer Science

⚡ Interested in parallel programming, software architecture and compilers (didn't find the time yet for the latter)

🚀 Current project: a distributed system for highly parallel solving of the n-queens problem, based on volunteer computing (work in progress, might be open source eventually)
