ðŸŒ± Studying Applied Computer Science

âš¡ Interested in parallel programming, software architecture and compilers (didn't find the time yet for the latter)

ðŸš€ Current projects: 
- [Upme](https://github.com/olepoeschl/Upme) - a cross-platform library for self-updating Java desktop applications
- a distributed system for highly parallel solving of the n-queens problem, based on volunteer computing (work in progress, might be open source eventually)
